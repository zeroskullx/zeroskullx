# Rogerio Felix

Hello! I'm a programmer with knowledge in several programming languages, but currently, I'm focused on React and Next.js. I have experience in web application development, from front-end to back-end, and I love working on challenging projects that allow me to learn new things. Additionally, I'm passionate about software development and am always seeking to improve and stay updated on the latest technologies and trends.
