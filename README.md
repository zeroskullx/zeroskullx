# Rogerio Felix

Hi ðŸ‘‹ I'm Brazilian, and I have been working in programming since 2010. However, I started studying and practicing since 1993. During the 90s and 2000s, I created several software applications, ranging from market solutions to video rental systems and TV repair services.

Currently, I specialize in developing systems with a focus on JavaScript and frameworks like Next.js. I am passionate about technology and constantly seek opportunities to learn and improve, staying up-to-date with industry innovations and trends. Let's code the future together!

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on ESPM
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python and A.I.
